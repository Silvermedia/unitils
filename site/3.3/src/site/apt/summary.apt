Summary
~~~~~~~
    Unitils is an open source library aimed at making unit and integration testing easy and maintainable.

    It is divided into several modules, each of them providing extra support for a certain aspect of your unit and
    integration tests. If you for example need mocking for your tests, just include unitils-mock as a dependency. If you
    would also want to load DbUnit data sets, just include unitils-dbunit.

    Below you can find a list of the modules and their features. Click on the title to go to the corresponding
    tutorial and examples.
