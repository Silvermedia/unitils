# If set to true, an implementation of org.unitils.dbmaintainer.constraints.ConstraintsDisabler will be used to disable

# Comma separated list of table names. The tables in question will not be cleaned by the DBCleaner. Tables like these
# typically contain rather static, read only or type data. The database version table, indicated by the property
# dbMaintainer.dbVersionSource.tableName, is preserved automatically, and doesn't have to be included in this list.
# The tables in the list specified by dbMaintainer.cleardb.itemsToPreserve are also left untouched.
# Note that the DBClearer doesn't take this list into account. So when fromScratch is enabled
# (dbMaintainer.fromScratch.enabled=true), these tables will be removed anyway. If you want some tables/views/sequences/...
# to be preserved when creating the database from scratch, add them to dbMaintainer.cleardb.itemsToPreserve
