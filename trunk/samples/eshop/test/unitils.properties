# This property specifies the underlying DBMS implementation. Supported values are 'oracle', 'db2', 'mysql' and 'hsqldb'.
# The value of this property defines which vendor specific implementations of ConstraintsDisabler, SequenceUpdater and
# DbClearer are chosen.

# This property specifies the database schema that is used. If specified, the DBMaintainer and the DBUnitModule presume
# that all database tables are created in the specified schema. For the DBMaintainer, this means that when clearing
# (dropping all tables) or cleaning (deleting all data) tables, only the tables in the specified schema are considered.
# For the DBUnitModule, this schema name is used by

# If set to true, the DBMaintainer will be used to update the unit test database schema. This is done once for each
# test run, before the execution of the first class annotated with @DatabaseTest, if any.

# If set to true, an implementation of org.unitils.dbmaintainer.constraints.ConstraintsDisabler will be used to disable
# the foreign key and not null constraints of the unit test database schema.
# The ConstraintsDisabler is configured using the properties specified below. The property with key 'database.dialect'
# specifies which implementation is used.

# Comma separated list of table names. The tables in question will not be dropped by the DBClearer, and not cleared
# by the DBCleaner. Tables like these typically contain rather static, read only or type data. The database version table,
