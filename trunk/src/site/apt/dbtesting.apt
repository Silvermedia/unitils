Unit testing the database access layer

 Unitils offers a complete and ready-to-start baseline to start with writing unit tests for classes that access a relational database.
 Unitils makes use of {{{www.dbunit.org}DBUnit}} for management of test data. A DBMaintainer has been developed to automatically update
 the state of the database.
